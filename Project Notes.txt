Project Notes
- Ensure you can check with phone and that it's not totally broken when you do
- Obviously finish my cart, checkout, and login
- Frame behind carousel is fixed height so when minimized is screwed up
- Add stock of product to db
- Perhaps add more visual elements, or conditional homepage elements if logged in
- Better footer with more info
- Clean up code. i.e., make product grid modular, move all inline styles to css file
- Maybe add an email or some other way of contacting. Email via chatbox would be nice.
- Snaky link thing at top left of page showing where you are would be good
- Login details should be hashed
