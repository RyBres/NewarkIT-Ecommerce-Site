Project Notes
- Ensure you can check with phone and that it's not totally broken when you do
- Perhaps add more visual elements, or conditional homepage elements if logged in
- Clean up code. i.e., make product grid modular, move all inline styles to css file
- Snaky link thing at top left of page showing where you are would be good
- Get both first and last name, or at least parse it
- inventory DB, and show how many items are left if low on product page
- Confirmation email and receipt after purchase
- Better my account page and more info (and more granular)
- Standard picture size on product pages
